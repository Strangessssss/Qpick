QPick is an online shop with many animations and pleasent design for different gadgets (Mainly Apple production).

Design had been taken from random Figma project and changed for my preferences.

Frontend includes technologies such as:

- Next.js
- Tailwind
- i18n

Backend includes technologies such as:

- ASP.NET (Minimal API)
- Entity Framework Core
- PostgreSQL

Whole project had taken 2 weeks to be completed.

This is the main page of the site where all the products are sorted by category and shown in grid.
